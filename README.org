* Capture Org to Clipboard

** Overview
Capture Org to Clipboard is a Chrome extension that allows users to capture selected content from a webpage and send it to Emacs via org-protocol using the `capture-html-to-clipboard` protocol. The captured content is converted to Org-mode format using Pandoc and includes an Org-style hyperlink for the source URL.

** Features
- Capture selected HTML content from any webpage.
- Convert HTML to Org-mode using Pandoc.
- Prepend an Org-style link for the source URL.
- Copy the converted Org content to the clipboard.

** Requirements
- Emacs with org-protocol enabled. Verify `org-protocol` is loaded: Evaluate `(featurep 'org-protocol)`, which should return `t`.
- Pandoc installed and accessible from your system's `PATH`. Verify `pandoc` is in your `exec-path`, this should return the path to the Pandoc executable:
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (executable-find "pandoc")
   #+end_src
- `org-protocol-capture-html` package installed: clone the repository: https://github.com/alphapapa/org-protocol-capture-html and follow the setup instructions in the repository to load the package.
** Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the source files.
2. Copy the `org-protocol-capture-to-clipboard.el` file to a directory in your Emacs `load-path`. Add the following to your Emacs configuration (e.g., `~/.emacs.d/init.el`):
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp/") ;; Adjust path as needed
   (require 'org-protocol-capture-to-clipboard)
   #+end_src
3. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
4. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in the top-right corner).
5. Click "Load unpacked" and select the directory containing the extension files.
6. Configure the keyboard shortcut:
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`.
   - Set a shortcut for "Capture and copy to clipboard" (e.g., `Ctrl+Shift+Y`).

** Usage
1. Highlight text on a webpage.
2. Press the keyboard shortcut (`Ctrl+Shift+Y` by default) to invoke the extension.
3. The selected content will be:
   - Converted to Org-mode format.
   - Prepended with an Org-style link to the source URL.
   - Copied to the clipboard.

** Example Output
If the selected text is:
- URL: `https://example.com`
- Title: `Example Title`
- Content: `This is the selected text.`

The clipboard will contain:
#+begin_example
[[https://example.com][Example Title]]

This is the selected text.
#+end_example

** Development
To modify or contribute to the extension:
1. Edit the relevant source files:
   - `manifest.json`: Extension metadata and permissions.
   - `background.js`: Handles the shortcut and executes the capture logic.
   - `org-protocol-capture-to-clipboard.el`: Emacs Lisp script for processing and sending content to Emacs.
2. Reload the extension via `chrome://extensions/`.
